The Riddle Project is a ROAAr project funded in part by the SSHRC dedicated to transcribing, solving, and researching riddles in early manuscripts. Prof. Nathalie Cooke, Associate Dean of ROAAr, led this project along with a team of graduate and undergraduate research assistants. McGill University Library’s mysterious and recently acquired ‘Doncaster Manuscripts’ prompted Prof. Cooke to explore the history of riddling in England, specifically, the subgenre of “enigmatical bills of fare” (Ebofs) or “table setting riddles.”  
 
Riddles and food have coexisted for centuries. This online exhibition focuses on culinary riddles from the 18th-20th centuries. Given to guests as dinnertime games, Ebofs or table setting riddles are menus that describe dishes in code. Guests could discuss, debate, and solve the riddles around the tables at these Conundrum Suppers, adding glimmers of frivolity to a community fundraiser, social happening, and holiday celebration.
In this portal, two web apps are accessible, an interactive map and a story map, developed for the Riddle Project, as well as a series of blog posts discussing the form and function of different riddles. So far, the team has uncovered over one thousand Conundrum Suppers, hundreds of culinary riddles, and countless instances of puzzling and amusements that demonstrate riddles are certainly not just for children.
