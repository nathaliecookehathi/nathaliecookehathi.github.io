The Riddle Project is an ROAAr project dedicated to transcribing, solving, and researching riddles in early manuscripts. The project is funded in part by the SSHRC and is led by Prof. Nathalie Cooke, Associate Dean of ROAAr, along with a team of graduate and undergraduate research assistants.

In this portal, you can access [two web apps](interactive-maps) developed for the Riddle Project, as well as [a series of blog posts](blog) helping illustrate the form and function of the different riddles.
