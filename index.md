The Riddle Project is an ROAAr project dedicated to transcribing, solving, and researching riddles in early manuscripts. The project is funded in part by the SSHRC and is led by Prof. Nathalie Cooke, Associate Dean of ROAAr, along with a team of graduate and undergraduate research assistants.

In this portal, you can access [two web apps](interactive-maps) developed for the Riddle Project, as well as [a series of blog posts](blog) helping illustrate the form and function of the different riddles. 

The [first web app](filters) is an interactive map, where filters can be set to manipulate which riddling events are visible. Points representing riddling events can be filtered by date, archive, or whether the dataset includes the actual riddle for the event. While this project is ongoing, the riddles on the site represent a large portion of the dataset collected by the Riddles Project.

The [second web app](story), which is also an ongoing project, is to build the interactive fitering map into a strolling story, helping clarify the salient patterns represented by the dataset of riddles for people being introduced to the dataset.
