The Riddles Project is led by Nathalie Cooke, Associate Dean of ROAAr, and includes an energetic team of research assistants as well as collaborators from across the departments of the McGill Library. Librarians, digitization specialists, cataloguers and researchers will work together to shed new light on the newly identified sub-genre of Enigmatical Bills of Fare (EBoFs), as well as working to research, transcribe, and solve riddles from early manuscripts.
