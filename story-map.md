<p>Scroll through the story map to see the ways different riddles connect. The story map helps clarify questions about riddle patterns and movement identified over the course of the project.</p><br><br>

<h2>Diving into the riddles</h2>
<p>Now that we have a sense of the distribution of riddles by location, let's take a deep dive into the distribution of riddling events over time. This interactive chart allows you to see how riddles are distributed over the week, year, and even across the entire 300-year period of riddling.</p>
<p>Toggling between "event date" and "newspaper publication date" shows differences in when the events actually occurred and when they were reported on.</p>

<p>What does this tell us? For one, riddling events weren't particularly popular in the summertime. It's also clear that weekend nights were the most common times of the week for riddling events to occur. You can also see that major period of riddling in the late 1800s and early 1900s: More than 90% of our dataset is concentrated between 1890 and 1920.</p><br><br>


<h2>Peaks in Riddling Events</h2>
<p>Now that we have a sense of the distribution of riddles over time, let's take a closer look at the riddles that make up these "hot points" of riddling in the late 1800s and early 1900s.</p>
