The <a href="visualizations/filters" target="_blank">first web app</a> is an interactive map where filters can be set to manipulate which riddling events are visible. Points representing riddling events can be filtered by date, archive, or whether the dataset includes the actual riddle for the event. While this project is ongoing, the riddles on the app represent a large portion of the dataset collected by the Riddles Project.

The <a href="visualizations/story" target="_blank">second web app</a>, which is also an ongoing project, is to build the interactive fitering map into a strolling story, helping clarify the salient patterns represented by the dataset of riddles for people being introduced to the dataset.
