There are two interactive maps for viewing the Riddles Project dataset.

The first, a [filtered map](https://riddlesproject.github.io/filters), allows the user to filter riddles based on their metadata and view information about each riddle, represented as points on a map.

The second, a [story map](https://riddlesproject.github.io/story), is a guided tour through the different riddles.
