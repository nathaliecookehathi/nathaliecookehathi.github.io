    <h3>How do holidays play into riddling practices?</h3>
        <p>Many of the riddles in this exhibition originated in 18th-19th century Britain. These were known as Enigmatic Bills of Fare (EBoFs). Enigmatic Bills of Fare were riddling menus which guests would be expected to solve before ordering their meals!</p>

    <h3>Distribution of Riddles by Day</h3>
         <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/visualizations/images/riddle-day-distribution.png" alt="Distribution of riddles by day of the year" style="width:100%">
        <p>Once again, it's useful to visualize the distribution of riddles by their day of release. Here, it's clear that riddles center around January and diminish in the summer. This is likely related to the twelve nights festivities that occur around Christmastime.</p>

    <h3>Christmas</h3>
        <p>Here's a look at only the riddle events which occurred on Christmas day. Or rather, the lack therof: Even though there is a peak in this period, no riddle events from this dataset were published on Christmas day. There's a simple answer for this: Newspapers likely weren't publishing on the holiday.</p>
