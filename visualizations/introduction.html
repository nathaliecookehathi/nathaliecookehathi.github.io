	 <h3>Introduction</h3>
		  <p>Riddles and food have coexisted for centuries. Our exhibition focuses on culinary riddles from the 18th-20th centuries. Culinary riddles were dinnertime games to be discussed, debated, and solved by guests around the table.</p>

	 <h3>Enigmatic Bills of Fare (1)</h3>
		  <p> Many of the riddles in this exhibition originated in 18th-19th century Britain. These were known as Enigmatic Bills of Fare (EBoFs).</p>
</section>
<section id='2'>
	 <h3>Enigmatic Bills of Fare (2)</h3>
		  <p>Enigmatic Bills of Fare were riddling menus guests would be expected to solve before ordering their meals. Many EBoFs were copied and circulated extensively among upper class circles.</p>
</section>
<section id='3'>
	 <h3>Enigmatic Bills of Fare (3)</h3>
		  <p>Most of the EBoFs we found originated in the United Kingdom. However, by the 19th century, we also found them in the United States.</p>
</section>
<section id='4'>
	 <h3>Enigmatic Bills of Fare (4) </h3>
		  <p>This suggests that during the 19th century, EBoFs were taken across the Atlantic. You can read more about EBoFs <a href="https://riddleproject.github.io/features/2019/11/24/graphs.html">here.</a></p>

	 <h3>Conundrum Suppers (1)</h3>
		  <p>Starting from the 19th century, we discovered hundreds of culinary riddles and riddling events from across the United States. </p>
</section>
<section id='6'>
	 <h3>Conundrum Suppers (2)</h3>
		  <p>Most of them were known as Conundrum Suppers. These were events from the 19th and 20th centuries, where guests would gather for riddling menus, games, and other conundrum-themed forms of entertainment.</p>
</section>
<section id='7'>
	 <h3>Conundrum Suppers (3)</h3>
		  <p> Conundrum Suppers were hosted primarily by Protestant Church communities across the United States. They often doubled as fundraising events during which guests would order à la carte from enigmatic menus.</p>
</section>
<section id='8'>
	  <h3>Conundrum Suppers (4)</h3>
	  		<p>Funds would often go toward Church renovations or communities in need. We found many menus from this period; click on the dots to see the riddles. You can read more about Conundrum Suppers <a href="https://riddleproject.github.io/features/2020/03/03/fundraising.html">here.</a></p>

	  <h3>NYS Conundrum Suppers (1)</h3>
	  		<p>These events were especially popular in New York State state and were often publicised by local newspapers. Two newspaper archives are represented here: New York State Historical Newspapers and Fulton History. </p>
</section>
<section id='10'>
	  <h3>NYS Conundrum Suppers (2)</h3>
	  		<p>These two archives alone contain evidence for 500 riddling dinners. While there are clusters in urban areas, most of the events we discovered took place in rural areas.</p>
</section>
<section id='11'>
	  <h3>US Riddling Dinners</h3>
	  		<p>Events from these archives were not unique to NY. While Conundrum Suppers seem to be more popular in the North-East, we found events from many different states across the country.</p>
</section>
<section id='12'>
	  <h3>Canadian Riddles (1)</h3>
	  		<p>We have even found riddling events in Canada. We have found a few events in British Columbia, as seen on the map...</p>
</section>
<section id='13'>
	  <h3>Canadian Riddles (2)</h3>
	  		<p>...and there are several scattered throughout Alberta and Saskatchewan as well.</p>
</section>
<section id='14'>
	  <h3>Canadian Riddles (3)</h3>
	  		<p>These riddling practices were even found in Quebec, some of which were published by Montreal newspapers. Events shown on the map are from the Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec.</p>
