# The Riddle Project: Interactive site

The Riddles Project is an ROAAr project dedicated to transcribing, solving, and researching riddles in early manuscripts. The project is funded in part by the SSHRC and is led by Prof. Nathalie Cooke, Associate Dean of ROAAr, along with a team of graduate and undergraduate research assistants.

This repository hosts the public facing website where users can interact with the dataset and view more information about the riddles collected by the riddles project.
