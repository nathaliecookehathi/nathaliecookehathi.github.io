Have you ever ordered food, just to be greeted with a dish of roaring laughter? At the *fin de siècle* of the 20th century, guests would gather at events called Conundrum Suppers, in which diners would order from menus written entirely in riddles. What was the point of this puzzling pastime? Well…because it was fun!

Clever guests would be pleased when their food arrived. However, the success of the event hinged on unfortunate victims! Following the orders, “[a]ll manner of laughable mistakes and surprises are sure to follow,”[1] because it was amusing to try and guess what your meal might be, “and many a person got rather a queer supper by his unlucky guesses.”[2] Some of the riddles were also funny jokes! Some “Elevated Felines,” perhaps? (Catsup, or Ketchup, in other words!)

The link between riddling menus and humour existed since at least the early 18th century. Last year, McGill acquired a comical riddling manuscript drawn by William Heath. Books like these were rented out by publishers “for evening parties, at which these portfolios of caricatures became a very fashionable amusement.”[3] Comical publications occasionally found their way to the riddling dinner table, producing hearty laughter.[4]
