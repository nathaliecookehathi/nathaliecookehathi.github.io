Riddles and EBOFs frequently share the same lines, suggesting that there is a transfer of riddling from supper to supper. This raises the immediate question of how, exactly, this is happening. Are riddles being shared based on their physical location? Are riddles being shared ina timely fashion, such that recurring riddles tend to come up in bursts and then fade away? Or is it random: Do riddles just pop up and fade out as a general fad?

To represent this, we constructed a network representing our data set of Enigmatic Bills of Fare (EBOFs), a genre of riddle. This set includes 34 EBoFs (composed of a set of lines) and 246 lines that appear in at least two EBoFs. 

For example: *The Ornamental part of the Head* appears in BOF_13, BOF_1, BOF_2, Y3202620781, DX1901678851, BB3206029243, BA3200055553, Y3200665511, DX1901245378, BOF_8, BOF_9, BOF_12, and BOF_14. To see how this line fits in, here is the complete text of BOF_13:

> 242.-AN ENIGMATICAL DINNER. MEAT, GAME, FOWL AND FISH.
> i. The ornamental part of the head.
> 2. The divine part of man.
> 3, A tailor's implement.
> 4. A blockhead.
> 5. The Grand Seigniors Dominions.
> [...]

The EBoF goes on; there are 39 unique lines contained in this riddle alone. Each line has its own answer, representing a dish to be served at that enigmatical dinner. *The ornamental part of the head* signifies that hare will be on the menu.

This is the visualization of the network. Each node represents an EBoF, labelled with its unique ID. The edges between nodes represent the number of lines shared between the two connected EBoFs.

Once the network was constructed, we used the Louvain community algorithm to determine clusters and the modularity score of the network; each node is colored by the cluster it is a part of (there are four unique clusters). The green cluster contains 13 nodes, the purple cluster contains 16 nodes, the orange cluster contains 5 nodes, and the blue cluster only contains BOF_3, which had no shared lines with any other BOF.

Clusters are divided very cleanly by period: 75% of BOFs in the purple cluster are post-1824 (the median year of publication), 92% of BOFS in the green cluster are pre-1824, and 80% of EBoFs in the orange cluster are post-1824. This is a strong indicator that proximity by time is an influence on how lines from BOFs are distributed, which makes sense. 

Tested purity by publishing location was less revealing because most EBoFs were published in England. Every cluster had roughly 60% purity by region, with all being majority EBoFs from London.
